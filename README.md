## Introduction
The solution presented is a user-oriented mobile application that has a system of recommendation for recipes. The system is constructed with artificial intelligence, in order to help the users choose more easily what to eat by automatically recommending various recipes depending on what they thought to be a good fit for them.
The concept of the system is of an easy to use mobile application focused on the user. This means that there are solid concepts and heuristics regarding the user interface and user experience for the purpose of making the navigation and understanding of the app as smooth as possible. Moreover, the recommendations given by the system are tailored to each user that utilises the app, making each relation between the user and the application unique.
