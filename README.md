The system is constructed with artificial intelligence, in order to help the users choose more easily what to eat by automatically recommending various recipes depending on what they thought to be a good fit for them.
The concept of the system is of an easy to use mobile application focused on the user. This means that there are solid concepts and heuristics regarding the user interface and user experience for the purpose of making the navigation and understanding of the app as smooth as possible.
